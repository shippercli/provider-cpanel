# Shipper CLI cPanel provider

Deploy and operate applications on cPanel accounts from Shipper CLI.

## Database inventory safety

Database and user inventories must be readable lists with unambiguous nonempty
identities. Missing, malformed, or duplicate inventory data fails apply instead
of being treated as an empty account. All configured database and user inventories are read before database creation,
password rotation, or privilege changes. Duplicate database identities and
conflicting configured passwords for a shared user are rejected. A shared user
with matching passwords is created once.
PostgreSQL usernames use the documented array of strings; object rows remain
accepted for compatibility. This preflight covers database resources; it is not a transaction or a
preflight of every deployment resource. Live account verification is required.

## Install

```bash
composer require shippercli/provider-cpanel
```

Shipper discovers the provider through Composer's plugin metadata. No cPanel
implementation is bundled into the CLI.

## Configure

Use a cPanel API token when the hosting provider allows one. Password
authentication remains available for hosts that do not expose account tokens.

```yaml
providers:
  cpanel:
    host: "cpanel.hosting.com"
    port: 2083
    username: "${CPANEL_USERNAME}"
    api_token: "${CPANEL_API_TOKEN}"

projects:
  app:
    provider: cpanel
    path: "."
    web_directory: /public
    profiles:
      production:
        branch: main
        domain: "api.example.com"
        deploy_path: "/api"
        runtime:
          type: php
          version: "8.4"
          install_dependencies: true
        cpanel:
          domain_type: existing
          backup_before_deploy: true
          release_retention: 5
```

See [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for runtime, database, cron, SSL,
release, and account-specific options.

## Operate

```bash
shipper validate
shipper plan app --profile=production
shipper apply app --profile=production
shipper status app --profile=production
shipper logs app --profile=production --lines=100
shipper rollback app --profile=production
shipper destroy app --profile=production
```

The implementation targets cPanel account UAPI, the remaining operations that
only exist in cPanel API 2, and optional privileged WHM API operations. See the
[capability model](docs/capabilities.md) for availability rules and the
[operations guide](docs/operations.md) for rollback and cleanup safety.
